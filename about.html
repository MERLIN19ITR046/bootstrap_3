          <h4 class="text-secondary">CCRT</h4>
          <p>The Centre for Cultural Resources and Training (CCRT) is one of the premier institutions working in the field of linking education with culture.
            Established in 1979, pioneered by Smt. Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay and Dr. Kapila Vatsyayan, it functions as an autonomous organization under the 
            aegis of Ministry of Culture, Government of India. At the philosophical core of the CCRT lies a commitment to holistic education, encompassing 
            the cognitive, emotional and spiritual development of children. </p>
        </div>
    </div>
      </div>
    <p class="container  font-weight-normal p-3">CCRT has been contributing to the strengthening of the foundation of the nation by making education culture based and meaningful. The CCRT has its 
      headquarters in New Delhi and three Regional Centres at Udaipur in the west, Hyderabad in the south and Guwahati in the north-east to facilitate 
      the widespread dissemination of Indian art and culture.</p>

             <h4 class="text-secondary">ROLE</h4>
             <p> CCRT’s main thrust is to make variety of training programmes for in-service teachers, teacher educators, educational administrators and students throughout
              the country. It also organizes special training programmes for the physically and mentally challenged children. The training programmes provide an understanding
               and appreciation of the philosophy, aesthetics and beauty inherent in Indian art and culture and focus on formulating methodologies for incorporating a cultural
                component in curriculum teaching. The role of culture in science and technology, housing, agriculture, sports i.e. in all aspects of development and growth is emphasised</p>

         </div>
     </div>
    </div>
    <p class=" container p-3">The importance of in-service teachers training was also stressed. Change in educational system can only be brought about if the teachers have been trained and prepared to 
      understand and recognise the need for a changes in the methodologies of teaching. Since the teacher training is limited to nine months, it cannot possibly produce teachers 
      well-versed in crafts</p>

                  are organized to create an awareness of the regional variations and richness of cultural expressions of our country.</p>
                  Collects and develops a library of resources in the form of scripts, digital photographs, audio and video recordings 
                   to encourage the art and craft forms of rural India and their revival</p>

                 <h4 class="text-secondary">PROGRAMMES</h4>
                 <p>The CCRT also implements some other important policies of the Ministry of Culture, e.g., awarding Scholarship to Young Artiste, Junior and Senior Fellowships focusing on "in-depth study/ research" 
                  in various facets of culture, these include New Emerging Areas of Cultural Studies. The CCRT has started organizing training programmes on arts management under NICHM Scheme, a new initiative of
                   Ministry of Cultural, Govt. of India. The CCRT is also implementing Cultural Heritage Young Leadership Programme, 
                  aimed at promotion of social values and community engagement amongst the youth of the Country</p>
